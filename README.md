Final Project App is the code submission as part of the Developing Data Products coursera through Coursera.

The file contains a ui.R & server.R script that build the visualization.

The visualization utilizes the esoph data set identifying cases of esophageal cancer across populations consuming 
different amounts of alcohol and tobacco.

There is also an RPubs document at http://rpubs.com/celizabeth/112641 detailing the app's funtionality.
